# Overview

1-Up-date is a library which attemps to reproduce, in a very simple an
consice way, the kind of ghost updates that [Google
Chrome](http://chrome.google.com) achieves.

Right now the library is in the very early stages of design so the
code here, at the moment, contains mostly experiments with the tools I
am planning to use and the architechture I am planning to implement.

I am developing the library in a mixture of windows/linux, however,
because of the packages design, it will be only windows once
implemented (I don't think any application can update itself in linux
without root permisions).
